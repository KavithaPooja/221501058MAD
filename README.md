# 221501058MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT-LAB
Project Overview
This project comprises several experiments that explore various facets of mobile app development. Each experiment focuses on key functionalities such as a secure login system, dynamic font customization, a basic calculator, and credential verification techniques. All features are modular and can be seamlessly integrated into other projects.

Features
Secure Login System:
This login system prioritizes security and includes the following:

Credential Validation: Ensures users enter valid usernames and passwords.
Error Handling: Provides clear feedback for incorrect login attempts.
Session Management: Manages user sessions securely. How it works: Users log in with a username and password. If valid, they are redirected to the main app screen. If incorrect, an error message is shown.
Dynamic Font Customization
This feature allows users to personalize font styles and sizes in the app.

Predefined Font Styles: Offers a variety of popular fonts to choose from.
Adjustable Font Sizes: Users can modify font size as per their preferences.
Instant Preview: Font changes are shown in real-time. How it works: Access the "Font Settings" from the settings menu and select your desired font style and size.
Calculator:
A simple yet effective calculator with basic arithmetic operations.

Supported Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for simplicity and ease of use. How it works: Open the calculator from the main menu, input numbers, and perform calculations.
Database Connection
Enabling database operations starts with establishing a secure connection.

Configuration: Specify connection parameters, including the database type, server address, database name, username, and password. How it works: Select the appropriate database driver (e.g., MySQL, SQLite), configure connection parameters, and connect.
Credential Verification
Enhances login security through various verification methods.

Email Verification: Sends a verification link to the user's email during registration.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Optional for added security.
Password Strength Checker: Encourages strong passwords. How it works: Users must verify their email address. 2FA can be activated from the security settings.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) & Speech-to-Text (STT)
TTS and STT technologies improve accessibility by converting text to speech and vice versa.

TTS: Converts text to natural-sounding speech, ideal for users who prefer audio-based information or have reading difficulties.
Use cases: Auditory feedback, reading notifications, or navigation in text-heavy areas.
STT: Converts spoken language into written text, enabling voice commands and transcription.
Use cases: Dictating messages, live transcriptions, or hands-free navigation.
Implementation Considerations:

API Selection: Choose an appropriate TTS/STT API (e.g., Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure).
Error Handling: Implement error management for unrecognized speech or API failures.
User Experience: Design the interface to be intuitive and user-friendly.
